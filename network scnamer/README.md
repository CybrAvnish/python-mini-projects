# Network Scanner

---

This project demonstrates a **Network Scanner** built using Python’s `scapy` module.

### 📡 Key Features

- Built from scratch using Scapy rather than relying on built-in utilities.
- Scans local networks to collect and display IP and MAC addresses.
- Crafts and sends custom packets to discover devices on the network.

### 🧰 About Scapy

Scapy is a powerful Python-based packet manipulation tool for computer networks. It allows users to:

- Forge or decode packets.
- Send packets over the network and capture responses.
- Perform network scanning, tracerouting, probing, and more.
- Conduct unit tests, perform network discovery, and simulate attacks (for ethical research only).

### ⚙️ Argument Parser

- The script includes an argument parser to accept user input directly via the terminal.
- Designed to work on Debian-based systems (e.g., Kali Linux).
