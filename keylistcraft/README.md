# 🔐 KeylistCraft

KeylistCraft is a Python-based tool that generates all possible combinations (keylists) from a user-provided set of characters. Built with simplicity and learning in mind, this script is ideal for basic wordlist creation in cybersecurity practice, password testing, and ethical hacking labs.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts any combination of characters (letters, numbers, symbols).
- Generates all possible strings where the length equals the number of input characters.
- Outputs:
  - Display directly in the terminal.
  - Save to a `.txt` file in the user's Documents folder.
- Adds colorful and styled terminal output using ANSI escape codes.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. The user provides a string of characters (e.g., `abc`, `123`, or `a1@`).
2. The script generates all possible **n-length** combinations (where `n = length of input`).
3. The user chooses to:
   - Print results in the terminal.
   - Save results to a uniquely named file in the Documents directory.
